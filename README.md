**Va**ala **ar**chive (**C** version) is an extremely fast archiving utility.

It's especially optimized for:

- ✅ Lots of small files
- ✅ NVMe disks

It's so fast because of:

- 🔧 Utilization of io_uring
- ♾️ High parallelism
- 🗝️ Weird POSIX & filesystem hacks

To use Vaar-C, you must have **Linux 5.6 or above**.
